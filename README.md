The Password Manager project is a comprehensive tool designed to securely store passwords and associated email addresses for various websites. It features a user-friendly interface built using Tkinter, where users can input website names, generate strong passwords, and save the details. The project integrates password generation functionality using the random module and allows users to copy generated passwords directly to the clipboard via the pyperclip module. Data is efficiently stored and managed in a JSON file, with support for search functionality to retrieve credentials by website name. Robust error handling ensures smooth user experience, including alerts for missing files and JSON errors, using Tkinter's messagebox. This project offers a simple yet powerful solution for password management
